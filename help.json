Also, if you are streaming music through Spotify or other music services, normal data usage will occur from those services."

            "response": "The red bar is required by iOS for any interaction that accesses the microphone in the background. When you minimize the app with the microphone active, you will see a red bar. In addition to being activated when you are in a conversation, there are other features, such as transparency that may be activating the mic even while you are not in a conversation. Donâ€™t worry, we are not the NSA and not recording any calls."

You should calibrate again if you walk into a quieter environment. We are working on making this easier / automatic."
